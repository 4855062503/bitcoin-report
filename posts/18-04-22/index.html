<h1 id=here-are-some-takeaways-from-bitcoin-2022>Here are some takeaways from Bitcoin 2022:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Stablecoins and confidential transactions are coming to lightning network via taproot thanks to Lightning Labs</li>
<li>CBDCs in US will not be similar to the digital Yuan but will be more privatized and there won&rsquo;t be a single Fed Coin (t. Cynthia Lummis).</li>
<li>Bitcoin will be accepted by Walmart, McDonalds, Starbucks and more by the end of 2022 thanks to Strike</li>
<li>Prospera and Madeira are making BTC legal tender. Mexico is working on it.</li>
<li>More companies are becoming lightning-focused</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=bronze-strategy>Bronze Strategy:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Remove any coin that&rsquo;s not Bitcoin from Bronze</li>
<li>Remove dependancy from Dasset, source a separate BTC liquidity provider, this may allow us to lower our fee or increase cut. Also, this hardens Bronze in the event that Dasset gets hacked or goes out of business</li>
<li>Have a separate non-signup website called BronzeBets that allows LN sports betting. The house takes a cut.</li>
<li>Look at lending later on</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=bronzebets-ux>BronzeBets UX:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Customer goes to BronzeBets.com</li>
<li>Customer chooses from a list of upcoming sports bets</li>
<li>Customer selects outcome from a drop-down list, enters sats they are willing to bet, then enters their email</li>
<li>LN Invoice shown on BronzeBets.com</li>
<li>Customer pays the invoice.</li>
<li>After event has finished, customer gets an email telling result, and a lnurl QR they can scan to redeem their sats if they won</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=demoing-bronze-at-bitcoin-2022>Demoing Bronze at Bitcoin 2022:</h1>
<p>We tried to make multiple purchases at the Bitcoin Conference via our LN withdrawals option.</p>
<p>Here is how the purchase would go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merchant presents LN invoice</li>
<li>We go to withdrawals in Bronze, select lightning, tap plus button, scan withdrawal</li>
</ul>
<p>The cheaper transactions (coffee etc) worked, however more expensive options (shirt etc) failed due to low liquidity (we need to top up or lightning channels)</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin Magazine was impressed by our development, even though our purchase failed when trying to buy a Bitcoin Magazine shirt.</li>
<li>The workers at the IBEX stand were impressed by our development too. We successfully bought a t-shirt ($1) using Bronze.</li>
