<h1 id=betplay>BetPlay</h1>
<p>BetPlay offered an easy Non-KYC way to play casino games on LN.</p>
<p>Their minimum LN deposit was $0.20USD, their unit of account for all games being in USD.</p>
<p>They advertised some games as being &ldquo;provably fair&rdquo;, by generating results using a cryptographic hash of a value generated by a client seed (me) and their server seed (them). In the case of their dice rolls, this SHA256 hash would be rounded to an integer which would be the outcome.</p>
<p>They offered more intricate casino games, with live events and bonuses.</p>
<p>Their account-creation and deposit was seameless.</p>
<p>Their withdrawal UX was bad.</p>
<p>To withdraw my $0.30USD, I had to first enter an invoice, which after the invoice, I was told to select balance (I pressed MAX). It then sent my balance to the invoice which didn&rsquo;t appear on my LN wallet.</p>
<p>This is usually not how LN transactions work unless using KeySend, in which I would give a node ID, and they could send how much they wanted to.</p>
<p>Because of their withdrawal process, I lost my sats.</p>
<p>Overall, I would not use this service again as their withdrawals are too risky.</p>
<p>I messaged their customer support, and got an instant reply.</p>
<p>They refunded my balance within 24 hours.</p>
