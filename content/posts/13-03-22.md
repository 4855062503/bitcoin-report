 [This service](https://lightningescrow.io/)
acts as a routing node between Alice and Bob, and sends to Bob from Alice if and only if Alice claims she recieved the goods that Bob promised to send.

Advantages:
- Typical escrow services which involve international transfers are slow (5 days +) and costly
- Real estate escrows eat up major fees (sometimes 5%)
- Not all escrow services are programmtic, so involve more central oversight which can be exploited
