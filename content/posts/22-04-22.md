# BetPlay

BetPlay offered an easy Non-KYC way to play casino games on LN.

Their minimum LN deposit was $0.20USD, their unit of account for all games being in USD.

They advertised some games as being "provably fair", by generating results using a cryptographic hash of a value generated by a client seed (me) and their server seed (them). In the case of their dice rolls, this SHA256 hash would be rounded to an integer which would be the outcome.

They offered more intricate casino games, with live events and bonuses.

Their account-creation and deposit was seameless.

Their withdrawal UX was bad.

To withdraw my $0.30USD, I had to first enter an invoice, which after the invoice, I was told to select balance (I pressed MAX). It then sent my balance to the invoice which didn't appear on my LN wallet.

This is usually not how LN transactions work unless using KeySend, in which I would give a node ID, and they could send how much they wanted to.

Because of their withdrawal process, I lost my sats.

Overall, I would not use this service again as their withdrawals are too risky.

I messaged their customer support, and got an instant reply.

They refunded my balance within 24 hours.

By the way they set up their LN withdrawals, you paste the invoice first, then send the amount, which limits the number of wallets that can recieve these type of "empty invoices" (BlueWallet cannot).

To get my funds back, I had to use Wallet of Satoshi.

In comparison, our Bronze withdrawals were faster. The BetPlay withdrawal took a few minutes and were not truly wallet-agnostic due to the design of their withdrawals (empty invoices).
