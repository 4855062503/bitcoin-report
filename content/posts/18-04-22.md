# Here are some takeaways from Bitcoin 2022:

- Stablecoins and confidential transactions are coming to lightning network via taproot thanks to Lightning Labs
- CBDCs in US will not be similar to the digital Yuan but will be more privatized and there won't be a single Fed Coin t. Cynthia Lummis
- Bitcoin will be accepted by Walmart, McDonalds, Starbucks and more by the end of 2022 thanks to Strike
- Prospera and Madeira are making BTC legal tender. Mexico is working on it.
- More companies are becoming lightning-focused

# Bronze Strategy:

- Remove any coin that's not Bitcoin from Bronze
- Remove dependancy from Dasset, source a separate BTC liquidity provider, this may allow us to lower our fee or increase cut
- Have a separate non-signup website called BronzeBets that allows LN sports betting. The house takes a cut.
- Look at lending later on

# BronzeBets UX:

- Customer goes to BronzeBets.com
- Customer chooses from a list of upcoming sports bets
- Customer selects outcome from a drop-down list, enters sats they are willing to bet, then enters their email
- LN Invoice shown on BronzeBets.com
- Customer pays the invoice.
- After event has finished, customer gets an email telling result, and a lnurl QR they can scan to redeem their sats if they won
