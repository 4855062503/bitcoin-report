[BMN](https://stokr.io/blockstream-mining) is a securitized Bitcoin Mining Node which has an expected lifespan of 3 years. 

Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream suggests that owning BMN has various benefits over just dollar-cost-averaging in Bitcoin.

These advantages are:
- $BMN is registered as a security so it can offer collateral on bank loans or mortgages
- The energy for mining is prepaid for already, so no BTC will be sold at bearish prices during dips to pay for the energy
- BTC price tends to lag behind hashrate, so during difficulty drops, BTC will be mined in larger quanitites than it could have been bought
- The Bitcoin is HODL'd by Blockstream until the 3 year life span, only the $BMN token can be sold on the secondary-market, so no BTC will be sold at a loss
