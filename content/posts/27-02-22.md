[Lot49](https://global-mesh-labs.gitbook.io/lot49/) is a lightning-network protocol developed by Global Mesh Labs which incentivizes the usage of Bitcoin for off-grid communication via mesh networks

In simple terms: If Alice wants to communicate to Bob, she can communicate to Alex, who is between her and Bob, who will take a routing fee in Bitcoin via Lightning to forward her message to Bob.

Global Mesh Labs has developed [GoTenna](https://gotenna.com/), a mesh network device.
